## Emission-points-NYS
This is a project that visualizes an emission points map. The mapping will be visualized using spatial analysis of the New York state emissions inventory data. 
The emission points mapping was implemented in Python 3.8, making use of folium package (Folium. Last access: October 13, 2023, Retrieved from https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/).

Emission points across New York State including main sampling sites for the NYS-VOC-Study for Volatile Organic Compounds and other parameters in the NYC metropolitan area. Heat map represents clustering of emission points and their VOC emissions. Circles depict a normalized VOC emission against the entire domain.

This repository stores the updated Python code and data to reproduce the analysis presented in the article:
